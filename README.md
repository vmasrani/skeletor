This is my fork of [skeletor](https://github.com/noahgolmant/skeletor), which uses [my fork](https://github.com/vmasrani/track) of [track](https://github.com/richardliaw/track). Both forks stay fairly close to the original, with the exception of my track's "project" object, which has a few modifications to make retrieving trial results easier. See the original repos for more information.
